== Description ==

Generate WooCommerce product feeds for all your marketing channels, such as Google Shopping (merchant center), Facebook Remarketing, Bing Ads, Billiger.de, Pricerunner, Vergelijk.nl and many more. Next to custom feeds there are over 100 pre-defined templates included for marketplaces, comparison shopping engines and search engines. This plugin provides high-quality product feed for Google Shopping and many many more.

= Why choose this plugin? =
Simply because this is the most complete plugin offering support for an unlimited number of products and feeds, including features such as category- & field-mapping and advanced, rule-based, filtering and product variables support.

= Our mission =
Offer free and advanced, intuitive, tooling and plugins for website owners and marketers to easily set-up and manage their online marketing campaigns.

== Plugin Features ==

= Unlimited number of products =
No limitations on the number of products you can put in your product feeds. This makes the AdTribes.io Product Feed PRO for WooCommerce plugin suitable for small, medium and big webshops.

= Unlimited number of product feeds =
No limitations on the number of product feeds.

= Filters and rules =
Set advanced filter and ruling per channel so only your most profitable products make it to the product feed. For example: exclude low-margin products, exclude products that are low on stock or only include products that are on sale. You name it, any filter or rule is possible!

= Field / attribute selection =
Determine yourself what attributes to in- or exclude in your product feed. This plugin supports usage of ALL attribute types: Custom Attributes, Dynamic Attributes and Product Attributes. Rule-of-thumb: the more attributes you put in your product feed, the better change you have of getting good listings on the channels of your choice.

= Field / attribute mapping =
Map your field attributes to those of the channels of your choice. For many channels using the right field names is obliged.

= Fix for WooCommerce structured data bug (Elite version) =
Because of a bug in WooCommerce variable products will get disapproved in Google's Merchant Center. WooCommerce adds the price of the cheapest variable product in the structured data for all variations of a product. Because of this there will be a mismatch between the product price you provide to Google in your Google Shopping product feed and the structured data price on the product landingpage. Google will therefor disapprove the product in its merchant center. You won't be able to advertise on that product in your Google Shopping campaign. Our plugin has a feature that will fix the structured data on variable product pages by adding the correct variable product price in the JSON-LD structured data so Google will approve the variable products you submitted. 

= Add critical Google Shopping Feed fields to your store (Elite version) =
Google requires you to add certain fields to the feed you create for Google Shopping. However not all of the required fields are present in WooCommerce. Our plugin add's these fields / attributes for you so you can create a product feed that meets Google's requirements. The plugin will add the following product input fields for you: Brand, GTIN, UPC, MPN, EAN, Product condition (New, Refurbished, Used) unit pricing measure, unit pricing base measure, installment and an Optimised title field.

= Performance based =
Only add products to your feed that had sales before in a given time-range. This will make your campaigns more profitable.

= Custom Fields =
Add custom fields with naming you require and fill it with static or dynamic values to your product feed.

= Static field values =
Add static field values to your product feed when needed.

= Category / taxonomy mapping =
Some marketing channels require you to map your categories to theirs (such as Google Shopping). This plugin enables you to exactly do that. Not only does it support 1-to-1 category mapping but you can also map subsets of products on a channel-category based on product names.

= Google Shopping =
Our plugin offers added and advanced features for creating the best possible product feed for Google Shopping. Feeds created by our plugin have a high approval rate on products in Google's Merchant center. Also, because of a WooCommerce bug in the structured data of variable products all of these products would normally be disapproved in Google's merchant center. Our plugin fixes this bug and enables you to advertise on all of your products in Google Shopping.

= Google Analytics support =
This plugin enables you to add and configure Google Analytics UTM tracking-codes to your product URL’s so you can measure the effectiveness of your marketing channels in Google Analytics. 

= Shipping class support =
This plugin enables you to set the shipping zone (and shipping class) so the right shipping cost end up in your product feed. Our plugin uses all shipping zone settings you have configured in WooCommerce (flat rates, classes and free shipping). Our support also supports US and Australian postal codes and regions.
